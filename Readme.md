# Student Report Card Generator 📝

This is a simple Java console-based application that generates a student's report card using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## 🛠️ Features

- Accepts roll number, name, and marks for 3 subjects
- Calculates total marks
- Assigns grades based on average marks
- Displays a neatly formatted report card

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation**: Student details are encapsulated within a `Student` class.
- **Constructors**: Used to initialize student data.
- **Arrays**: Marks are stored and iterated through using arrays.
- **Control Structures**: Loops and conditionals for logic implementation.
- **Modular Code**: Code is separated into multiple methods for clarity.

## 📁 File Structure

- `Main.java`: Handles user input and creates a `Student` object.
- `Student.java`: Contains the class logic for computing total and grade, and displaying the report card.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy the code.
2. Compile both files:
   ```bash
   javac Student.java Main.java
3. Run the program:
